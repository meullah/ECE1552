## Lab: Tic-Tac-Toe

### Overview
In this lab you will become familiar with **bitwise operators** while rehearsing the skills obtained in the previous weeks. You will be recreating the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ using console input and output. 

**In the process you will:**
  * Make use of **control** and **repetition** structures for input validation.
  * Make use of **bitwise operators** to handle the underlying bits in a variable.
  * Apply **formatting** rules to console output. 
  * Replicate the **gameplay** of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.


### Introduction to Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a kid's game consisting of a 3x3 grid and two players. The players, X and O, take turns marking a spot in the grid. The player who places three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. It is also possible for the game to end in a tie. See an example below.

### Lab Task
Your task in this session is to write a program that takes a Tic-Tac-Toe game and determines who won. 
Let's assume we have the match below. From the left grid it is clear that player O won the match. The grid on the right is the match's binary representation. We are using a one to represent X's marks and a zero to represent O's marks.
