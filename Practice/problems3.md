## Practice Questions
The following questions are not for credit. Use them as supplemental material to study for your quizzes and prepare for your future homework assignments.

* **Question #1:** Write a program that determines whether a number is **prime** or not. Use recursion to implement this behavior. The program should validate all input. 

```
Input a positive number: 3
Is number 3 prime?: Yes

Would you like to try another number? (Yes = 1 / No = 0): 1

Input a positive number: 6
Is number 3 prime?: No

Would you like to try another number? (Yes = 1 / No = 0): 0
```

* **Question #2:** Use Euclid's algorithm to find the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two numbers. Use recursion to implement this behavior. The program should validate all input. Watch the video below to understand how the algorithm works.
