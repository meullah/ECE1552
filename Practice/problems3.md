## Practice Questions
The following questions are not for credit. Use them as supplemental material to study for your quizzes and prepare for your future homework assignments.

* **Question #1:** Write a program that determines whether a number is prime or not. Use recursion to implement this behavior. The program should validate all input. 

```
Input a positive number: 3
Is number 3 prime?: Yes

Would you like to try another number? (Yes = 1 / No = 0): 1

Input a positive number: 6
Is number 3 prime?: No

Would you like to try another number? (Yes = 1 / No = 0): 0
```

* **Question #2:** Use Euclid's algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Use recursion to implement this behavior. The program should validate all input. Watch the video below to understand how the algorithm works.
