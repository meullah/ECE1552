## Practice Questions
The following questions are not for credit. Use them as supplemental material to study for your quizzes and prepare for your future homework assignments.

* **Question #1:** Write a program that prints an empty student roster template. The professor inputs the number of students that he has and the program generates an empty template for the professor to fill in. Make sure to include `iomanip` and `iostream` for this exercise. You might want to take a look at how to use `setw()` and `setfill()` with `cout`.
