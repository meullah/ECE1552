## Final Project: Simon

### Overview
For this final project your goal is to create an imitation of the famous memory game **Simon**. The game consists of four colored LEDs and four push buttons. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up the LEDs in a random order. The player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons associated with the LEDs. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.  

If you haven't played the game before, check [this site](http://www.freesimon.org). (Flash player required)

**In the process you will:**
  * Review how to **interface** with push buttons.
  * Review how to **debounce** a push button.
  * Discover how to **play sounds** using a piezo buzzer.
  * Make use of **arrays** to store game data.
  * Make use of **control** and **repetition** structures for gameplay.
  * Create and make use of **functions**.

In the end, your system should look like the one presented below.
