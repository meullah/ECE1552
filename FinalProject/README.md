## Final Project: Simon

### Overview
For this final project your goal is to create an imitation of the famous memory game **Simon**. The game consists of four colored LEDs and four push buttons. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up the LEDs in a random order. The player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons associated with the LEDs. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.  

If you haven't played the game before, check [this site](http://www.freesimon.org). (Flash player required)
